Since January 2022, I have been a post-doctoral researcher at EPF Lausanne in the "Scientific Computing and Uncertainty Quantification" ([CSQI](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/csqi/)) group, with Prof. Fabio Nobile. My main interests here are the development and analysis of model order reduction algorithms for the surrogate modeling of parametric frequency-domain applications.

I was awarded my Ph.D. title in Mathematics at EPF Lausanne in December 2021. My Ph.D. work under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Nobile is summarized in my thesis, titled "Model order reduction based on functional rational approximants for parametric PDEs with meromorphic structure" (available [here](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/289347/files/EPFL_TH9271.pdf)).

Before that, I got my Master's degree at EPF Lausanne, with a thesis on "Randomized low-rank approximation of matrices and tensors" (available [here](/files/masters_randomized_low-rank.pdf)), under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Kressner.

I have also contributed to the organization of the [model order reduction summer school 2020](https://archiveweb.epfl.ch/morss2020.epfl.ch/), a virtual event hosted at EPFL with the objective of disseminating knowledge on model order reduction.

Research interests
=====

My research interests lie at the intersection of:

- model order reduction (non-intrusive surrogate modeling of parametric problems)

- approximation theory (rational and non-smooth approximation)

- numerical discretization of PDEs (finite elements, boundary elements, virtual elements)

- wave-propagation applications (wave, Maxwell, and Helmholtz equation, scattering problems)

- scientific computing (high-performance and parallel programming)

Being an _applied computational mathematician_, my research work so far has been characterized by a balance between theory (possibility of approximation, convergence, stability) and applications (optimal design problems in electrical and mechanical engineering, simulation of wave propagation, algorithmic efficiency).
