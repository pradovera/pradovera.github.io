2019	Distributed sampling for rational approximation of the acoustic scattering of an airfoil	PAMM 19	In this paper we compute a reduced order model for a time‐harmonic external acoustic scattering problem with parametric frequency. The employed technique is , an explicit moment‐matching method for Hilbert space‐valued meromorphic maps. We study the approximation and stability properties of this technique for different choices of the sample point set, namely fully distributed in the parameter range, and partially and fully confluent. The proposed technique is also compared with an implicit multi moment‐matching method based on Galerkin projection.	F. Bonizzoni and D. Pradovera	pamm		10.1002/pamm.201900422
2020	Fast Least-Squares Pad&eacute; approximation of problems with normal operators and meromorphic structure	Math. Comput. 89	"In this work, we consider the approximation of Hilbert space-valued meromorphic functions that arise as solution maps of parametric PDEs whose operator is the shift of an operator with normal and compact resolvent, e.g., the Helmholtz equation. In this restrictive setting, we propose a simplified version of the Least-Squares Pad&eacute; approximation technique studied in [ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal. 52 (2018), pp. 1261-1284] following [J. Approx. Theory 95 (1998), pp. 203-2124]. In particular, the estimation of the poles of the target function reduces to a low-dimensional eigenproblem for a Gramian matrix, allowing for a robust and efficient numerical implementation (hence the ""fast"" in the name). Moreover, we prove several theoretical results that improve and extend those in [ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal. 52 (2018), pp. 1261-1284], including the exponential decay of the error in the approximation of the poles, and the convergence in measure of the approximant to the target function. The latter result extends the classical one for scalar Pad&eacute; approximation to our functional framework. We provide numerical results that confirm the improved accuracy of the proposed method with respect to the one introduced in [ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal. 52 (2018), pp. 1261-1284] for differential operators with normal and compact resolvent."	F. Bonizzoni, F. Nobile, I. Perugia, and D. Pradovera	fast		10.1090/mcom/3511
2020	Least-Squares Pad&eacute; approximation of parametric and stochastic Helmholtz maps	Adv. Comput. Math. 46	The present work deals with rational model order reduction methods based on the single-point Least-Square (LS) Pad&eacute; approximation techniques introduced in Bonizzoni et al. (ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 52(4), 1261-1284 2018, Math. Comput. 89, 1229-1257 2020). Algorithmical aspects concerning the construction of rational LS-Pad&eacute; approximants are described. In particular, we show that the computation of the Pad&eacute; denominator can be carried out efficiently by solving an eigenvalue-eigenvector problem involving a Gramian matrix. The LS-Pad&eacute; techniques are employed to approximate the frequency response map associated with two parametric time-harmonic acoustic wave problems, namely a transmission-reflection problem and a scattering problem. In both cases, we establish the meromorphy of the frequency response map. The Helmholtz equation with stochastic wavenumber is also considered. In particular, for Lipschitz functionals of the solution and their corresponding probability measures, we establish weak convergence of the measure derived from the LS-Pad&eacute; approximant to the true one. 2D numerical tests are performed, which confirm the effectiveness of the approximation methods.

2020	Interpolatory minimal rational model order reduction of parametric problems lacking uniform inf-sup stability	SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 58	We present a technique for the approximation of a class of Hilbert space-valued maps which arise within the framework of Model Order Reduction for parametric partial differential equations, whose solution map has a meromorphic structure. Our MOR stategy consists in constructing an explicit rational approximation based on few snapshots of the solution, in an interpolatory fashion. Under some restrictions on the structure of the original problem, we describe a priori convergence results for our technique, hereafter called minimal rational interpolation, which show its ability to identify the main features (e.g. resonance locations) of the target solution map. We also investigate some procedures to obtain a posteriori error indicators, which may be employed to adapt the degree and the sampling points of the minimal rational interpolant. Finally, some numerical experiments are carried out to confirm the theoretical results and the effectiveness of our technique.	D. Pradovera	mri		10.1137/19M1269695
2021	Shape optimization for a noise reduction problem by non-intrusive parametric reduced modeling	Proc. WCCM-ECCOMAS2020	We study a PDE-constrained optimization problem, where the shape and liner material of the nacelle of an aircraft engine are optimized in order to minimize the noise radiated by the engine. More precisely, the acoustic problem is modeled by the Helmholtz equation with varying wavenumber k on an exterior domain. A model reduction strategy is employed to alleviate the cost of the design optimization: the minimal rational interpolation technique is used to construct a surrogate (w.r.t. k) for the quantity of interest at fixed shape/material parameter values, and a parametric model order reduction approach is employed to combine surrogates at different shape/material designs, resulting in a non-intrusive methodology. Numerical experiments for shape and shape/material optimization are provided, to showcase the effectiveness of the presented methodology.	F. Bonizzoni and D.

2021	Non-intrusive double-greedy parametric model reduction by interpolation of frequency-domain rational surrogates	ESAIM:M2AN 55	We propose a model order reduction approach for non-intrusive surrogate modeling of parametric dynamical systems. The reduced model over the whole parameter space is built by combining surrogates in frequency only, built at few selected values of the parameters. This, in particular, requires matching the respective poles by solving an optimization problem. If the frequency surrogates are constructed by a suitable rational interpolation strategy, frequency and parameters can both be sampled in an adaptive fashion. This, in general, yields frequency surrogates with different numbers of poles, a situation addressed by our proposed algorithm. Moreover, we explain how our method can be applied even in high-dimensional settings, by employing locally-refined sparse grids in parameter space to weaken the curse of dimensionality. Numerical examples are used to showcase the effectiveness of the method, and to highlight some of its limitations in dealing with unbalanced pole matching, as well as with a large number of parameters.

2022	A technique for non-intrusive greedy piecewise-rational model reduction of frequency response problems over wide frequency bands	J. Math. Ind. 12	In the field of model order reduction for frequency response problems, the minimal rational interpolation (MRI) method has been shown to be quite effective. However, in some cases, numerical instabilities may arise when applying MRI to build a surrogate model over a large frequency range, spanning several orders of magnitude. We propose a strategy to overcome these instabilities, replacing an unstable global MRI surrogate with a union of stable local rational models. The partitioning of the frequency range into local frequency sub-ranges is performed automatically and adaptively, and is complemented by a (greedy) adaptive selection of the sampled frequencies over each sub-range. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method with two numerical examples.	D. Pradovera and F. Nobile	wide		10.1186/s13362-021-00117-4
2020	Frequency-domain non-intrusive greedy Model Order Reduction based on minimal rational approximation	To appear in SCEE 2020 Proc.	"We present a technique for Model Order Reduction (MOR) of frequency-domain problems relying on rational interpolation of vector-valued functions. The selection of the sample points is carried out adaptively according to a greedy procedure. We describe several options for the choice of a posteriori error indicators, which are used to drive the greedy algorithm and define its termination condition. Namely, we illustrate a tradeoff between each estimator's accuracy and its ""intrusiveness"", i.e. how much information on the underlying high-fidelity model needs to be available. We test numerically the effectiveness of this technique in solving a non-Hermitian eigenproblem and a microwave frequency response analysis."	D. Pradovera and F.

2021	Rational-based model order reduction of Helmholtz frequency response problems with adaptive finite element snapshots	Submitted	We introduce several spatially adaptive model order reduction approaches tailored to non-coercive elliptic boundary value problems, specifically, parametric-in-frequency Helmholtz problems. The offline information is computed by means of adaptive finite elements, so that each snapshot lives on a different discrete space that resolves the local singularities of the solution and is adjusted to the considered frequency value. A rational surrogate is then assembled adopting either a least-squares or an interpolatory approach, yielding the standard rational interpolation method (SRI), a vector- or function-valued version of it (V-SRI), and the minimal rational interpolation method (MRI). In the context of building an approximation for linear or quadratic functionals of the Helmholtz solution, we perform several numerical experiments to compare the proposed methodologies. Our simulations show that, for interior resonant problems (whose singularities are encoded by poles on the real axis), the spatially adaptive V-SRI and MRI work comparably well. Instead, when dealing with exterior scattering problems, whose frequency response is mostly smooth, the V-SRI method seems to be the best-performing one.	F. Bonizzoni, D. Pradovera, and M.
