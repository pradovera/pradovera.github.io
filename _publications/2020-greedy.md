title: "Frequency-domain non-intrusive greedy Model Order Reduction based on minimal rational approximation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-greedy
excerpt: 'We present a technique for Model Order Reduction (MOR) of frequency-domain problems relying on rational interpolation of vector-valued functions. The selection of the sample points is carried out adaptively according to a greedy procedure. We describe several options for the choice of a posteriori error indicators, which are used to drive the greedy algorithm and define its termination condition. Namely, we illustrate a tradeoff between each estimator&apos;s accuracy and its &quot;intrusiveness&quot;, i.e. how much information on the underlying high-fidelity model needs to be available. We test numerically the effectiveness of this technique in solving a non-Hermitian eigenproblem and a microwave frequency response analysis.'
