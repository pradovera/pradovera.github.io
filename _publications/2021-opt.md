title: "Shape optimization for a noise reduction problem by non-intrusive parametric reduced modeling"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-opt
excerpt: 'We study a PDE-constrained optimization problem, where the shape and liner material of the nacelle of an aircraft engine are optimized in order to minimize the noise radiated by the engine. More precisely, the acoustic problem is modeled by the Helmholtz equation with varying wavenumber $k$ on an exterior domain. A model reduction strategy is employed to alleviate the cost of the design optimization: the minimal rational interpolation technique is used to construct a surrogate (w.r.t. $k$) for the quantity of interest at fixed shape/material parameter values, and a parametric model order reduction approach is employed to combine surrogates at different shape/material designs, resulting in a non-intrusive methodology. Numerical experiments for shape and shape/material optimization are provided, to showcase the effectiveness of the presented methodology.'
