collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-parametric
excerpt: 'We describe a novel algorithm for solving general parametric (nonlinear) eigenvalue problems. Our method has two steps: first, high-accuracy solutions of non-parametric versions of the problem are gathered at some values of the parameters; these are then combined to obtain global approximations of the parametric eigenvalues. To gather the non-parametric data, we use non-intrusive contour-integration-based methods, which, however, cannot track eigenvalues that migrate into/out of the contour as the parameter changes. Special strategies are described for performing the combination-over-parameter step despite having only partial information on such &quot;migrating&quot; eigenvalues. Moreover, we dedicate a special focus to the approximation of eigenvalues that undergo bifurcations. Finally, we propose an adaptive strategy that allows one to effectively apply our method even without any a priori information on the behavior of the sought-after eigenvalues. Numerical tests are performed, showing that our algorithm can achieve remarkably high approximation accuracy.'
