title: "Implementation within Akantu of smooth contact mechanics with the mortar method"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-mortar
excerpt: 'The scope of this project is the implementation of the mortar method for the enforcement of smooth contact constraints in an open-source finite element framework. Smooth contact constraints are rigorously defined, and two approaches to their enforcement (penalty and Lagrange multipliers) are derived rigorously. A detailed description of a complete algorithm for the application of such methods is provided, with a particular attention to the strategies used to tackle non-linearities. Then a brief presentation of the most important features of the implementation of the algorithm is given. To check the correctness of the implementation, several tests are performed: in particular the numerical results are compared with the hertzian solution for a problem of unilateral smooth contact.'
