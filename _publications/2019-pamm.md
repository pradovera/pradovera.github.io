title: "Distributed sampling for rational approximation of the acoustic scattering of an airfoil"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-pamm
excerpt: 'In this paper we compute a reduced order model for a time-harmonic external acoustic scattering problem with parametric frequency. The employed technique is minimal rational interpolation, an explicit moment-matching method for Hilbert space-valued meromorphic maps. We study the approximation and stability properties of this technique for different choices of the sample point set, namely fully distributed in the parameter range, and partially and fully confluent. The proposed technique is also compared with an implicit multi moment-matching method based on Galerkin projection.'
